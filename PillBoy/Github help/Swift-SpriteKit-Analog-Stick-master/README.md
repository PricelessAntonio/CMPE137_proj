### Features
- tracking joystick with closures
- set/change joystick diameter
- set/change stick & substrate colors
- set/change stick & substrate images

### Manual
1. Just drop the **AnalogJoystick.swift** file into your project.
2. That's it!

### Init examples:
***init with 100px diameter.Colors & images you can change later***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100)
```
***Substrate has 100px diameter, stick has 50px diameter***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50))
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has blue color, stick has yellow color***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()))
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has "substrate" image, stick has "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has blue color && "substrate" image, stick has yellow color && "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has blue color && "substrate" image, stick has yellow color && "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has blue color, stick has yellow color***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has "substrate" image, stick has "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```

### Designated initializator
``` swift
init(substrate: AnalogJoystickSubstrate, stick: AnalogJoystickStick)
```
**WHERE:**
- **substrate** Substrate of joystick (AnalogJoystickSubstrate:AnalogJoystickComponent)
- **stick** Stick of joystick (AnalogJoystickStick:AnalogJoystickComponent)

### Convenience initializators:
``` swift
convenience init(diameters: (substrate: CGFloat, stick: CGFloat?), colors: (substrate: UIColor?, stick: UIColor?)? = nil, images: (substrate: UIImage?, stick: UIImage?)? = nil)
convenience init(diameter: CGFloat, colors: (substrate: UIColor?, stick: UIColor?)? = nil, images: (substrate: UIImage?, stick: UIImage?)? = nil)
```

### Typealias
``` swift
typealias AnalogJoystick = ðŸ•¹
```
## Example
``` swift
let joystick =  ðŸ•¹(diameter: 110) // let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 110)
```

### Computed Properties
- var trackingHandler: AnalogStickMoveHandler? (get/set)
- var stickColor: UIColor (get/set)
- var substrateColor: UIColor (get/set)
- var stickImage: UIImage? (get/set)
- var substrateImage: UIImage? (get/set)
- var diameter: CGFloat (get/set)

## Examples
### Create joystick
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100) // you can set images/color later
```
**or with images**
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
### Tracking With Closure
``` swift
joystick.trackingHandler = { jData in
  // something...
  // jData contains angular && velocity (jData.angular, jData.velocity)
}
```
**or**
``` swift
func handlerTracking(data: AnalogJoystickData) {
  self.appleNode?.zRotation = jData.angular
  // something...
  // jData contains angular && velocity (jData.angular, jData.velocity)
}

joystick.trackingHandler = handlerTracking
```
### Change diameter
``` swift
  joystick.diameter = 100 // set new diameter
```
### Change colors
``` swift
  joystick.stickColor = UIColor.red() // set red color to stick node
  joystick.substrateColor = UIColor.purple() // set purple color to substrate node
```
### Change images
``` swift
  joystick.stickImage = UIImage(imageNamed: "yourStickImage") // set image to stick node
  joystick.substrateColor = UIImage(imageNamed: "yourSubstrateImage") // set image to substrate node
```
